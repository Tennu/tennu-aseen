# tennu-aseen 1.0.0

A plugin for the [tennu](https://github.com/Tennu/tennu) irc framework.

Hooks into the dbcore and uses the data from dblogger to check when someone last spoke.
Working on also detecting if things like quit, kick and nick changes will trigger the seen but I primarily use tennu on Gamesurge and it still doesnt have too great of support for IRCu based servers.
